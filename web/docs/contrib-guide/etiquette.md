# Etiquette

Rolldown is a open-source project and only have a few people working on it. We have found that there are disputed contributions come over and over again. Similar arguments show up repeatedly and no lessons were learned.

As much as we encourage contributions, we also expect people to follow general guidelines to ensure a positive and productive environment for everyone.

We will appreciate any contribution, but there are certain situations where we may not be able to accept them.

## Unforeseen features/changes

Before implementing a new feature or making a significant change, please create an issue to discuss it first. This will help us to understand the feature better and provide feedbacks for both maintainers and contributors. We have met cases like:

- Implement a feature that is already done by other maintainers/contributors
- Implement a big feature that is far from the current milestone
- Refactor a part of the code that is going to be removed or rewritten
- Refactor a part of the code without knowing the background and break current behaviors

Depending on the situation, unforeseen features/changes may be postponed or on hold forever.

## Opinionated preferences

There are many ways to implement a feature or fix a bug and many ways to do other things. From our experiences, it's really hard to convince people that which one it's better. Similar arguments were made repeatedly and no lessons were learned.

We come up a conclusion in the end: it's just simply not worth it. So if your contribution contains opinionated preferences and refuse to be changed, there will be no arguments but with the contribution being on hold forever.

We hope you understand the reasons behind these guidelines. We have spend much time unnecessarily on these things and they are bad for one's mental health.

People make mistakes and so do we. If you have any questions, there following ways to reach us:
